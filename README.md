# Chat App

## Objective

To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native.
The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## Description

### Key features:

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and send button.
- A button in the text field provides additional communication options: sending images, taking images, location data.
- The app asks for permission before accessing these communication features.
- Data gets stored online and offline.
